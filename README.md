efm32-common
============
This repository contains CMSIS and emblib, including the EFM32GG device, the STK3700 and device specific drivers.

Currently, all the dependencies needed to create Rust-bindings for the EFM32GG_STK3700 are found in this repository.
This repository might be split into several smaller repositorys later, depending on how it suits the project structure.
